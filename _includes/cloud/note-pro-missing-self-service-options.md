On Pro projects, we recommend updating yaml configuration files in an Integration environment and testing the changes before pushing to Staging and Production environments. If you discover that configuration changes are not applied after you push to a Production or Staging environment and redeploy your {{site.data.var.ee}} site, submit a [Support ticket](http://support.magento.com). Indicate the configuration changes needed and include the updated yaml configuration file in the ticket.
